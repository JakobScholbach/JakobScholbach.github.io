<h1>Nijmegen 23</h1><br>
<br>
In a realm where minds converge and unite,<br>
Simon and Vicky, guardians of the flame,<br>
With motives pure, they seek the highest height,<br>
A gathering they organize, earning acclaim.<br>
<br>
Within these walls, where intellect ascends,<br>
Representation theory finds its grace.<br>
Mysteries unravel where beauty blends,<br>
Intricate motives, finely laced.<br>
<br>
Moduli spaces come alive with light,<br>
Vibrant people and areas intertwine,<br>
Ideas ignite, expanding our sight,<br>
A symphony of concepts, so divine.<br>
<br>
With purpose and passion, you pave the way,<br>
Each speaker, participant has a say.<br>
Oh, Simon and Vicky, we're in your debt,<br>
For a week where motives, moduli, and representations met.
